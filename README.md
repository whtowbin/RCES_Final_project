Final Project Proposal
I plan to analyze laser ablation mass-spectroscopy data. I have several time series of Laser ablation analyses that have been collected at Lamont. Some of these are from profiles as the laser is rastered across a mineral to look for zonation.
The rows are each one timestep and the columns are in counts per second for each element. I plan to differentiate the background signal from the measurements for each element and setup basic elemental analysis using the standard’s we have measured. Currently we use an Excel sheet with macros to calculate our concentrations. This method does not account for drift in the standard’s measurements with time. Ideally I would update the method to account for drift and other factors effecting the accuracy of our measurements.
